# Project_1_Slots

My first mobile Android application.

This app is a simple slot-machine style game. The user starts with $5, each time the go button is pressed, the flowers spin and a random one (of 3) is chosen. If none match user loses a dollar, if 2 match user gains a dollar, if all three match user gains $3. 
A reset button appears after the first press of go which can be used to reset the game state
